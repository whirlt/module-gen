# SYSTEMLESS MODULE GENERATOR

This BASH script creates a magisk module based on what font family you give it.
Use the script as follows:

    ./module-gen.sh <font1> <font2> <font3> ...

Before running the script, you have to rename the fonts accordingly for them to be replaced when the module is loaded.<br>
For example:

Something like `ProductSans-Bold.ttf` would be renamed to `Roboto-Bold.ttf`.
